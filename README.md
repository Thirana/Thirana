### Hi there! 👋

- 💻 I'm a developer who enjoys building websites with Next.js.

- 🚀 I'm exploring Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solutions, along with various authentication providers and serverless computing options. I'm learning how these technologies integrate with full stack web development, including API design, user authentication flows, database services, hosting and deployment methods.

- ☁️ I'm also passionate about and currently learning how AWS services can be used in real-world software development & exploring the working processes behind ML and Neural network models to better understand how they function & how they can to solve real-world problems.

- 🔍 I am always eager to keep in touch with the latest technologies and trends that help make my development and day-to-day tasks easier.
